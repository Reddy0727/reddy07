              <p>
              Many have come to a misconception that SEO has become ineffective in the B2B space, but the reality is, more than 70% of B2B purchases begin their buying process with a generic search.

Though SEO has become challenging day by day, it is still one of the best channels for B2B.

It involves various activities such as setting up the ads, optimizing the ads, setting a budget and most importantly placement of ads. SEM can be carried out on various search engines but is done predominantly on Google. Google supports paid advertising on its search engine and partners called Google Ads.</p>

<p>SEM is the most effective marketing strategy in the B2B space. Its impact is immediate and as soon as you launch your campaign, you can see your ads showing on SERPs. With SEM, you will have the luxury to define your target audience and you can filter them based on age, interests, location, habits and more. You can also keep a track of ROI which makes SEM more effective for B2B.</p>

<h4>Pay-Per-Click (PPC)</h4> 
<p>PPC is an online method for advertising where a business only pays for its ads when a person clicks on them.</p> 
<h4>Email Marketing</h4>
<p>Email marketing enables businesses to send branded, promotional content directly to prospective customers via email. The use of automated newsletters is common in this context. </p>
<h4>Affiliate Marketing</h4>
<p>Affiliate marketing is a performance-based exercise that enables revenue sharing and pay-per-sale (PPS) compensation within a common network. </p>
